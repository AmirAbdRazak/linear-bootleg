# Software Project Management Application

This is an app made by me to practice my Full Stack skills, ranging from Front-End skills with React and Tailwind, to managing Server-Side Rendering and Static Site Generation using NextJS, to managing a database with PostgreSQL and Prisma, as well as managing Authentication using NextAuth with API handling with tRPC.

This is the inspiration where I refer my code a bit: https://github.com/tuan3w/linearapp_clone
I probably have taken roughly a dozen lines of code directly from this. But the rest of the code I mainly 
just type it out myself.
